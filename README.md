# PHS Hacktoberfest
Go to the [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ "Hacktoberfest website") for more information. You need to sign up for the event with github on their [website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ "Hacktoberfest website").
## The Premise
The whole idea behind Hacktoberfest is for devs to get involved in open source. This means posting your code for anyone to be able to look at, take inspiration from, and use. To complete the challenge, you have to make 5 pull requests. A pull request in its simplest form is a contribution to an open source repository, such as this one.
## Instructions
Look at the folders in the repo. Inside each folder is a .md file that contains the instructions for the problem. You may use whatever programming language you would like to. Make sure to claim the problem by going to the issue titled the problem you are interested in and stating what language you would like to solve it with. If it already claimed by someone, you can claim it as well, but you must use a different programming language. Create a solution for the problem and create a pull request submitting that solution. While you will most like not need to submit a full project containing multiple files to solve these problems, if you chose to make sure that you upload the files in a folder. *I will be adding more problems at time progresses and I will do my best to create problems with varying difficulty.*
## How to make a pull request
There are loads of Youtube videos and articles on this topic, but for our purposes, all you will need to do is upload a file.
1. Fork this repository.
  - Top right corner of the screen.

2. In the forked repository (it will say `forked from DanielChapin/PHSHacktoberfest` under the name of the repo), upload your file to the apropriate folder.
  - Click on the folder which you will upload to.
  - Click the `Upload files` button.
  
  ![Upload files](https://github.com/DanielChapin/PHSHacktoberfest/blob/master/Upload%20Files%20Button.png?raw=true "Upload files")

  ![Commit Title](https://github.com/DanielChapin/PHSHacktoberfest/blob/master/Commit%20title.png?raw=true "Commit Title")
3. Create a pull request from your forked repository.
  - Click `New pull request`
  
  ![New Pull Request](https://github.com/DanielChapin/PHSHacktoberfest/blob/master/New%20Pull%20Request.png?raw=true "New Pull Request")
  - Compare the master branch of the DanielChapin/PHSHacktoberfest repo to the master branch of your forked repo and click create pull request.
