# PHS Hacktoberfest (WIP) :fa-github:
Go to the [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ "Hacktoberfest website") for more information. You need to sign up for the event with github on their [website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ "Hacktoberfest website").
## The Premise
The whole idea behind Hacktoberfest is for devs to get involved in open source. This means posting your code for anyone to be able to look at, take inspiration from, and use. To complete the challenge, you have to make 5 pull requests. A pull request in its simplest form is a contribution to an open source repository, such as this one. 
## How to make a pull request
There are loads of Youtube videos and articles on this topic, but for our purposes, all you will need to do is upload a file.
1. Fork this repository.
  2. Top right corner of the screen.

  2. Click the `upload files` button.

  2. Click
1. Repeat until you have completed the challenge!

## Instructions
In the issues tab is a list of projects/problems that you can submit an entry for. You may use whatever programming language you would like to. Make sure to claim the problem stating what language you would like to solve it with. If it already claimed by someone, you can claim it as well, but you must use a different language. Create a solution for the problem and create a pull request submitting that solution. While you will most like not need to submit a full project containing multiple files to solve these problems, if you chose to make sure that you upload the files in a folder.
