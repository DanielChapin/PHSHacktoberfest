# Three Divisibility
Create a function that is passed an integer value `num` and checks if num is divisible by three by checking if the sum of the digits of num is divisible by 3.

Have the function return a boolean that states whether num is divisble by three or not.

Example:
```
num = 123456
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21
21 is divisible by 3
return true

num = 1234
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
10 is not divisible by 3
return false
```
