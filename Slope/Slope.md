# Slope
Create a function that takes either 2 of the languages Point classes, 2 tuples (which act as points), or just x1, y1, x2, y2.

It should calculate and return the slope between those two points.

The function should return a floating point value (a decimal).

Example:
```
Point(0, 10), Point(10, 10)
returns 0
```
